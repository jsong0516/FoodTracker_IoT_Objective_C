# Activity Streams - Food

##  Introduction
<a name="introduction" />
This document presents and defines Object types and Verbs for Activity Streams for Food App which will be developed for INFO 290: Internet of Things at University of California, Berkeley.

## Verbs
<a name="verbs" />
This specification defines the following core verbs in addition to the default <tt>post</tt> verb that is defined in Section 6 of [activitystreams][activitystreams]:

<table border="1">
  <tr><th align="left" width="5%">Verb</th><th width="50%" align="left">Description</th><th align="left" nowrap="nowrap">Example</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>eat</tt></td>
    <td>Indicates that the actor has ate the object. For instance, a person eating a food.</td>
    <td nowrap="nowrap">
      <pre>
{
  "actor": {
    "objectType": "person",
    "displayName": "Byung Gon Song"},
  "verb": "eat",
  "object": {
    "objectType": "food",
    “displayName”: “hamburger”}
}
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>consume</tt></td>
    <td>Indicates that the actor has consumed the calories of the object. For instance, a person consuming a calories of the object.</td>
    <td>
      <pre>
{
  "actor": {
    "objectType": "person",
    "displayName": "Aldrich Ong"},
  "verb": "consumed",
    "object": {
      "objectType": "calories",
      “displayName”: "700"}
}
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><tt>add</tt></td>
    <td>Indicates that the actor has added the object to the target. For instance, adding calories to the collection of food diary. </td>
    <td>
      <pre>
  {
    "actor": {
      "objectType": "person", 
      "displayName": "Byung Gon Song"},
    "verb": "add",
    "object": {
      "objectType": "calories", 
      "content": 700},
    "target": {
      "objectType": "collection",
      "displayName": "Byung's Eating Diary",
      "objectTypes": ["calories"]
    }
  }
      </pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Object Types
<a name="object-types" />
The table contains the core set of common objectTypes in addition to the "activity" objectType defined in Section 7 of [activitystreams][activitystreams].

All Activity Stream Objects inherit the same fundamental set of basic properties as defined in section 3.4 of [activitystreams][activitystreams].  In addition to these, objects of any specific type are permitted to introduce additional optional or required properties that are meaningful to objects of that type.

<table border="1">
  <tr><th align="left">Object Type</th><th align="left">Description</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>food</tt></td>
    <td>Represents any kind of food object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>calories</tt></td>
    <td>Represents calories of food.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><tt>collection</tt></td>
  <td>Represents a generic collection of objects of any type. This object type can be used, for instance, to represent a collection of files like a folder; a collection of photos like an album; and so forth. Objects of this type MAY contain an additional objectTypes property whose value is an Array of Strings specifying the expected objectType of objects contained within the collection.</td>
  </tr>

</table>


## Object Properties

### actor

#### http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/#activity

Describes the entity that performed the activity. An activity MUST contain one actor property whose value is a single Object.


### content 

#### http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/#activity

Natural-language description of the activity encoded as a single JSON String containing HTML markup. Visual elements such as thumbnail images MAY be included. An activity MAY contain a content property.

## Comments
We are re-using 'add' verb and 'collection' object type from https://github.com/activitystreams/activity-schema/blob/master/activity-schema.md because other apps consume such Activity Steams might able to consume our Activity Steam as well.

Our "eat" verb can possibly used for nofication of the actor's meals to a external application.
